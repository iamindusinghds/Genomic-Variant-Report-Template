Genomic Variant Report Template

This project demonstrates a structured HTML/CSS-based genomic reporting template designed for WES/WGS variant summaries.

Features:

Tabular variant representation (Gene, Chromosome, Position, Classification)

Severity-based classification styling:

🔴 Pathogenic

🟢 Benign

🟠 VUS (Variant of Uncertain Significance)

Clean clinical-style formatting

Designed for integration with Python-based NGS pipelines

Purpose:

To simulate the reporting layer of genomic diagnostics workflows, where variant data (e.g., from VCF files) is formatted into clinician-readable reports.
